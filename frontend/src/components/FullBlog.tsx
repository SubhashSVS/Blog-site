                Starting a blog was one of the most rewarding things Iâ€™ve done in my career. As someone who loves writing and connecting with readers, having an outlet to share my thoughts while potentially helping others has been an incredible experience.

                When I first began blogging a few years ago, I really had no idea what I was doing. I would just sit down at my computer whenever inspiration struck and write whatever came to mind. Sometimes I would publish posts without even proofreading them because I was so eager to get my ideas out there.
